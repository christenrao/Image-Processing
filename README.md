# Image-Processing
This project involves classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset from Scikit-learn. It includes preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis, and building a classifier to recognize digits (0-9) from pixel intensity patterns. The focus is on applying image processing techniques and using machine learning for accurate classification.
