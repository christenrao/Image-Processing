### MNIST Image Processing Project

#### Project Name
**MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification using Image Processing**

#### Description
This project focuses on image processing and classification using the **digits dataset** from Scikit-learn, which contains 1,797 images of handwritten digits (0-9) represented as 8x8 pixel grids. The primary goal is to explore pixel intensity patterns and develop a classifier capable of accurately recognizing handwritten digits using machine learning algorithms like Random Forest.
